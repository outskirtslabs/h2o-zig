# libh2o for zig

This is [libh2o][h2o], packaged for Zig with cross-compilation support for Linux and macos.

- all dependencies are statically linked into the output
- output is a static library (`.a`) for embedding into other projects

The intended usage is for building language bindings and FFI wrappers that need to expose all h2o and SSL symbols in a final shared library.

Included features:

- http 1
- http 2
- quic + http3
- brotli
- zstd

h2o features explicitly excluded:

- mruby
- memcached integration
- redis integration
- libuv

[h2o]: https://h2o.examp1e.net/


- Supported zig version is 0.15.2
- Current h2o version is:

## Installation

First, update your `build.zig.zon`:

```
# Initialize a `zig build` project if you haven't already
zig init
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/outskirtslabs/h2o-zig.git
```

You can then import `h2o` in your `build.zig` with:

```zig
const h2o_dependency = b.dependency("h2o", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
your_exe.linkLibrary(h2o_dependency.artifact("h2o-evloop"));
```

### Build Options

The following build-time flags are available:

- `-Duse-boringssl=<bool>` - Use BoringSSL instead of OpenSSL (default: `true`)
- `-Duse-external-brotli=<bool>` - Use external brotli dependency instead of vendored sources (default: `true`). The vendored one is from upstream h2o and is a much older version than the external one.

Example usage:

```zig
const h2o_dependency = b.dependency("h2o", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
    .@"use-boringssl" = true, // default
});
your_exe.linkLibrary(h2o_dependency.artifact("h2o-evloop"));
```

Or via command line when building:

```bash
zig build -Duse-boringssl=true
```

## Notes

Supported targets

- linux x86_64
- linux aarch64
- macos x86_64
- macos aarch64
